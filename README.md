# Simple-Harmonic-Motion
# SHM Visualizer with Damping and Frequency Control

This Python project visualizes **Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)** and a **damped sine wave** using `matplotlib`. It includes interactive sliders to control the amplitude, frequency, and damping values in real time.

## 🎯 Features

- Real-time animated plotting of:
  - SHM wave at frequency 1 (default 1 Hz)
  - SHM wave at frequency 2 (default 2 Hz)
  - Damped sine wave (decay factor adjustable)
- Interactive sliders for:
  - Amplitude
  - Frequency 1 (Freq1)
  - Frequency 2 (Freq2)
  - Damping factor

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib` (for animation and widgets)

## 📦 Installation

Make sure you have Python installed. Then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib

📊 Output Preview
The window will display 3 animated plots:

SHM wave with frequency of 1 Hz

SHM wave with frequency of 2 Hz

Damped sine wave

Sliders at the bottom allow real-time adjustment of parameters.
